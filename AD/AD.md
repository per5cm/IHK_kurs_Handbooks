## Epigraph

>Active Directory Survival Guide

>by Alchemist, with a touch of madness

This is not a Microsoft doc. This is a field journal from the trenches of IT. Here you will find the raw rituals of creating OUs, wrangling groups, and resurrecting locked accounts.

The official docs will bury you in corporate incense and jargon — here you get the stripped-down gospel: click, type, curse, repeat. Each command is tested in fire (and occasionally fueled by too much coffee).

Forget marketing fluff. This is Active Directory as it really is: stubborn, brittle, yet somehow holding the whole damned company together.

So grab your keyboard, use good old-fashioned click-and-drop, and remember:

You don’t manage AD. You survive it.

**inspired by Hunter S. Thompson, but applied to AD madness.**
